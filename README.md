ProteinViewer_VR 

This repository contains a Unity3D project with a template room for visualising proteins in VR. A single protein model is contained as an example.

To use it, just download/clone and select the folder with the contents of the repository in Unity3D. A "template_room" scene is contained.
Then, it is only necesasry to convert any relevant PDB files to OBJ files using (for example) VMD. This pipeline is detailed in an upcoming paper. After conversion, simply drag and drop the OBJ file (and its corresponding MTL file) into Unity and you should be good to go!
